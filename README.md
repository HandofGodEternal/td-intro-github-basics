what do you understand by Git?
An acronym for for GIT is Global Information Tracker.
Git is also a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Define Version Control:
Version control is a system that tracks every changes of a file in a Project or set of files in a project over time in other for you to get specific versions of the files/project later in the future. it allows one to revert a selected file or the entire project back to a previous state, it compare changes over time, sees who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when.

Describe the process of committing a project to github repository:
After creating or making changes to your project, you will have to add the changes or file, then you commit it before pushing it to your remote repository as shown below
git add .
git commit -m "description of your project or file you created or modified"
git push
